# Oslo Elm Day 2019 - Emulating the Nintendo Game Boy CPU with Elm

Thank you for your interest in my talk. To keep things short on stage, I omitted a list of resources I recommend if you're interested in low-level stuff or the Game Boy in particular. This README contains a bunch or resources to get started.

# Talk Recording
As soon the recording is live, I'll link it here.

# Talk Demos
My talk featured two demos, the first is the Game Boy emulator that I built in Elm. [You can play it here (Works best in Chome)](https://malax.github.io/elmboy/) or [explore the source](https://github.com/Malax/elmboy).

The second demo featured a rediculously simplified Game Boy emulator that calculates Fibonacci numbers. The code is in this repository you're currently reading the README of. If you want to run this - just clone this repository, type `npm install` followed by `npm start` and you're good to go.

### [The Ultimate Game Boy Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI)
Very in-depth talk about the Game Boy and how it works. This talk also covers all the other subsystems if you're interested in them. I watched this a lot in the beginning of the process implementing Elmboy.

### [Game Boy Opcode Table](http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html)
Opcode Table for the Game Boy CPU. This is what I used to keep track of my implementation process.

### [Awesome Game Boy Development](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev)
A curated list of awesome Game Boy (Color) Development resources, tools, docs, related projects and open-source ROMs. A treasure trove!


## Low-Level Programming Games
If you're interested in low-level programming but just want to play with it a bit, there are awesome indie games out there that teach you low-level programming and remove all the quirks real hardware has - you can just start playing.

### [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/)
Puzzle game that revolves around re-discovering an old computer by reading manuals and writing low-level code for it. I played this a lot on my iPad. Very much recommended.

### [Shenzhen I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/)
Made by the same company that built TIS-100. Similar, but not the same. This game also makes you build hardware.

### [Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)
Another puzzle game involving programming _people_ like a computer. Distopic but surely fun!
